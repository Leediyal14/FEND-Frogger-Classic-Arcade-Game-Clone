### How the Game Works

   * The game board consists of six rows and five columns which have different ground patterns.

   * It has one Player and four Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.


### Instructions

   * The player can move LEFT:point_left:, UP:point_up:,RIGHT:point_right: and DOWN:point_down: using arrow keys.

   * The enemies (bugs:beetle:) move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board.

   * Once the player collides with an enemy:collision:, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square.

   * Once the player reaches the water:surfer: which is the top of the game board, the player won and the game resets.

   * When a Player wins the game, an alert appears to congratulate the player:clap::clap::clap: If the Player collides with an enemy, the Game Over alert displayed.
